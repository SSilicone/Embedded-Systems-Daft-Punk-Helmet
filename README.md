# Embedded-Systems-Daft-Punk-Helmet
Final Project for Dr. Choi's ECE 428 Embedded Computer Systems. The objective is to implement two input peripherals and two output actuators into a working Embedded System.

I've decided to create a Daft Punk helmet that uses surrounding audio (preferably music) and interfaces it with a microcontroller that controls the output of the helmet's LED screen into a spectrogram or some other fun visual. It would also have an on board music player (most likely a homemade MP3) that sends music through a buffer for it to be modulated in real time (frequency, play speed, etc) and output on some affordable speaker.

2 Inputs:
- Surrounding audio into a microphone
- songs uploaded to a makeshift MP3 (or SD card)

2 Outputs:
- Helmet LED screen
- Modified music on peripheral speaker
